        <p>I am a English/French bilingual math/physics tutor. I also am a freelancing software engineer, independent researcher, open source contributor, blogger, and terrible speller.</p>
        <p>
            My research interests are in statistical physics, numerical methods in discrete geometry, and digital signal processing. And I like to tinker (checkout my <a href="https://crates.io/crates/grateful-cli">latest software thing</a>.) 
        </p>
        <p>
        Previously I studied math and physics at <a href="https://www.mcgill.ca/">McGill</a>, and worked as an undergraduate research scholar at the <a href="https://www.physics.mcgill.ca/research/" target="_blank">McGill Physics department</a> with <a href="https://www.physics.mcgill.ca/~sievers/">Jonathan Sievers</a>, and <a href="https://www.math.mcgill.ca/gantumur/index.html">Gantumur Tsogtgerel</a>. In early 2022 I attended my first (half) batch at the <a href="https://recurse.com">Recurse Center</a>.

          My teaching philosphy is pragmatic. I value hard work over talent and humility over bravado. 
          <br/><br/>I expect my students to work hard between sessions so that we have something to talk about during. In the sessions we will focus on concepts that you struggled with and problems that you solved or failed to solve.

          <br/><br/>Learning math is hard work, for everyone, including the so called 'naturally talented'. The easiest way to work hard is to enjoy working hard, to enjoy the process of (metaphorically) banging your head against a wall over and over again until it budges. Its my mission to show you the beauty and joy of finally understading a difficult concept. 

        <br/><br/>That said, I'm a pragmatist and I understand that not everyone enjoys math. If you need to pass a test or improve your GPA I will do my best to help you to achieve your goals.

                <a href="https://barbaraoakley.com/books/a-mind-for-numbers/">A Mind For Numbers</a> by Barbara Oakly. Studying this book in my penultimate year of high-school was a formative meta-learning process for me; it helped me boost my baccalaureat grade by 13% (about one standard deviation.) It introduces concepts such as focus vs diffuse learning, working memory vs long-term memory, spaced repetition, chunking, how to think about procrastination (with a zombie metaphore,) how to build habits, the pomodoro technique, and how to deal with stress.

                Daniel Khaneman's <a href="https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/11468377-thinking-fast-and-slow">Thinking Fast and Slow</a> has a good discussion of cognitive biases and introduces the System 1 / System 2 framework of cognition (invented by Khaneman himself.)

                Josh Waitzkin's <a href="https://www.joshwaitzkin.com/the-art-of-learning/">The Art of Learning</a> focuses on mastery of skills that one is already good at. I highly reccomend making use of the accompanying <a href="https://www.joshwaitzkin.com/study-guides">study guid</a> to get the most out of this book.

                <a href="https://www.alfiekohn.org/">Alfie Kohn</a>'s writing. He thinks about parenting and pedagogy. He has some outlandish views but he's certainly doing something rightâ€”I'm friends with his son who was one of the brightest math undergraduates, breezing through grad level math courses at the age of 18.

                Being a scout leader for two years (2016-2018) for the XIeme troupe des Scoutes Pluralists de Beliquge. Growing u scout leaderp as a scout and then transitioning to being a mentor taught me some imporant pedagogical lessons. I believe that many teaching methods that apply to kids also apply to adults, and that the main difference between kids and adults is that kids better learners, and they are more straightforward about their emotions.

                Bhuddist theory. Those of you unfamiliar with Bhuddism might find it surprising that a religion would have anything to do mastering cognitive skills like math. However, many Bhuddist practices are centered on keeping your mind alert, coping with stress, and being happy, which are important for learning effectively.
